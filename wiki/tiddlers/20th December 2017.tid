Struggling with my ankle today! Had Cristmas lunch. Wasn't able to arganize drinks.

Tried to install Anaconda on my Surface, but was unable to find the notes I made on the Mac.

[[Installed TiddlyDesktop|Install TiddlyDesktop windows]] and wrote this note.

Will need to add ~TiddlyDesktop to PATH for it to work properly.
