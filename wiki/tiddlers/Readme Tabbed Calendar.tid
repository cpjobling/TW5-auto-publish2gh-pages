title: Readme Tabbed Calendar
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This is a simple example of a tabbed picture calendar to give the new or casual ~TiddlyWiki users some ideas. It uses <a href="http://bjtools.tiddlyspot.com#ExtendableCalendar" target="_blank">BJ's Calendar Plugin</a> to make the calendars and create journal entries.

I have not included any example entries, since you might use a different Journal Tag and/or Journal Title date format, see [[$:/ControlPanel]]

The dates included on each Month Tab were just an example of how you might note important dates like birthdays or anniversaries for quick reference. Sorry if I mixed up any country's dates. Or you might place some short quotes or verses in this area. If you hide the Sidebar, you can have larger pictures. Like I said, just trying to give some ideas.

To edit a month tab, click on the picture,

For the @@color: red;''2022''@@ calendar, all are tagged @@color: red;''tabcal22''@@, so use Advanced Search with `[tag[tabcal22]]` for the Filter and export as JSON. Then import that into your ~TiddlyWiki.
