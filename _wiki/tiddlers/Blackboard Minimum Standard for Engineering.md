# Blackboard Minimum Standards

## Guidelines for the college of engineering

### Why do we need standards?

* To provide an easy to use and predictable user experience for students and their supporters
* To enhance the information provided to students and to encourage their active participation in their own learning
* To ensure that materials provided to students are available in advance and designed to be inclusive
* To provide a solid baseline from which colleagues can go on to develop active and blended learning opportunities

### Who are the standards for?

* Students
* Academic staff
* Academic mentors
* Support staff

### What Are The Standards?

* Module Site Menu
* Automatically Populated Content Areas
* Module Content and Inclusivity
* Assessment and Feedback Area

### Module Site Menu

The slide illustrates the course menu as it is set up on newly created Blackboard sites.

Think of the menu as the top-level table of contents for your module.

As a consistent menu layout helps students to navigate between different module sites, it’s a good idea to keep to this structure. You can add to it, but should only remove or rearrange items if your particular module warrants it.

The next few slides explore each menu item and the expected purpose of each section. 

#### Home Page

The **Home Page** is the first page your student will see. 

By default, this is the [notifications dashboard](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Courses/Set_Up_Notifications/Notifications_Dashboard) which gives quick access to announcements, tasks due, what's new etc.

This page works best for students if you make use of the built-in announcements and tasks features to record the activities that you want students to do next. 

See [How to Work with Notifications](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Courses/Set_Up_Notifications/Notifications_Dashboard#how-to-work-with-notification-modules_OTP-2) for help on using these features.

Some colleagues prefer to make the **Announcements** page or one of the **Module Contents** pages the Home Page. This is fine, and is easily done, but how to do this is outside the scope of this presentation.

#### Announcements

The **Announcements** page is where you post news about your course. For example, you could post a welcome message before the module starts, post a “what’s coming” message at the start of each week or topic, reminders about assessments due, module evaluation surveys, timetable changes etc.

*slide*

Blackboard Learn provides a number of ways for students to access announcements, including the block on the **Home Page** previously mentioned, email, and the mobile app. Thus you may wish to save space and reduce redundancy by hiding the Announcements link from the course menu.

Even if you feel you can hide the Announcements link, we’d recommend that you leave it in the menu (it will appear like the **staff support** link at the bottom of the menu) as it makes posting a new announcement a little quicker.

#### Module Information

The **Module Information** page is for general information about the module that this Blackboard course site is intended to support. Most of the information is automatically added to your site by special widgets that will extract information from the **Course Catalogue** and other Intranet systems

*slide*

Most of the information is automatically added to your site by special widgets that will extract information from the **Course Catalogue** and other Intranet systems

As a minimum, this section should contain a brief **module synopsis**, a description of the **module learning outcomes**, the **module syllabus** and a list of the main **assessment components**. For the moment this last item needs to completed manually (see Next slide). 

Eventually, it is expected that more information will be extracted automatically from information provided in module maintenance. You may of course extend or rearrange the content of this page, and the others on the site, as you see fit, providing that this basic minimum content, or its equivalent, is maintained. 

It is also considered good practice to introduce your students to your module site at the start of a new module. This is particularly important if you depart significantly from the templated sections and menu items, or make or intend to make significant use of the additional features and tools provided in Blackboard. The SALT team can advise you about the facilities and tools available and how they might be used in your modules.If any of the information automatically added to the Module Information page is incorrect, it will need to be updated in the module catalogue on the intranet. If you are the **Module Coordinator**, that’s you but you can contact the College Student Experience Team or Aled Philips, Head of Student Records, for assistance.

Other things that you may wish to consider adding to this section are shown on next few slides.


##### Assessment components

A section like this one for Modern Control Systems is required. At the moment, this has to be added manually, but it should match the **Assessment Information -> Component Descriptions** maintained in Module Maintenance and published in the Handbook. 

#### Good practice recommendations

In addition to the minimum standards Consider adding one or more of the following:

##### About this Blackboard Module Site

Is an introduction to the module. You might also want to consider creating a video or an audio introduction.


##### Teaching plan

like this one for Aerospace Structures

##### Module calendar

A module calendar: such as this one created in Google Calendar and embedded using [these instructions]( https://www.lifewire.com/embed-google-calendar-website-or-blog-1616957). 

(I don’t recommend the Blackboard calendar!)

#### Staff Contacts

This is intended to be a way of introducing the module teachers to the students.

*slide*

As delivered, the **Staff Contacts** page is an empty “content area” (or Course folder) containing the hidden message shown.

Watch the video on the next slide to see how you can use the **Contacts** feature to create a **Staff Contact** record for each member of the teaching team.

*video*

#### Module Content

*slide*

Each module should contain **indication** of what each classroom session will contain; as topic titles themselves are rarely that informative. This **may** take the form of adding <u>at least one</u> of the following:

* Access to any presentation or discussion materials e.g. handouts, notes, PowerPoint, Prezi, pdf, Keynote, Beamer, Slideshare etc
* A summary of the main arguments
* A structure/outline of the session to be accompanied with a ‘further reading’ section
* You may wish to add additional folders to help organise content for your students

These would refresh the minds of students who did attend and provide some guidelines for absent students on where they can go to access further information.

Since 2014/15 University policy has specified that session materials be uploaded at the start of the course, or at least 24 hours before the start of each classroom session. The aim is to help students prepare better for the session and allow them to view the contents and add notes using mobile devices.  

For help with how to comply with the minimum requirements please contact the SALT team [salt@swansea.ac.uk](mailto:salt@swansea.ac.uk). Alternatively, please log a call on the ISS Servicedesk: [servicedesk.swansea.ac.uk/ServiceDesk.WebAccess/ss/](https://servicedesk.swansea.ac.uk/ServiceDesk.WebAccess/ss/).

#### Assessment and Feedback

The **Assessment and Feedback** area is one of the most important sections in your course site. It is important that you make this section easy for the student to use so that it is clear what you will want them to do to gain credit on your module, how you want them to do it, what a good submission looks like, provide an assessment calendar and/or list of tasks so that they can plan their work, and ensure that the links to the assessments are clear.

*slide*

As a minimum the **Assessment and Feedback** section should contain a summary of the assessments and an assessment and feedback calendar for your module, the assessment criteria for each component of assessed work, links to TurnitIn for text-based submissions or the Blackboard Assessment tool for other types of assessment, links to any quizzes you have set, and a link to the ASK assignment planner. 

Your assessment criteria can take the form of **TurnitIn Feedback Studio** or **Blackboard Grade Centre** rubrics, if you are using these tools, you should make a statement to this effect so that it is clear to your students where they can find the assessment criteria.

##### Summary of Assessment

The simplest **summary of assessment** would be a copy of the **Assessment Components** item from the **Module Information** Page (example 1). 

Alternatively, you may prefer to have a summary on the **Module Information** page and more detail on the **Assessment and Feedback** page (example 2). 

Or, if there are detailed instructions, you may wish to provide a detailed document as an attachment (example 3). This option is also more convenient if your coursework has to be moderated by an external examiner of provided for accreditation!

##### Assessment criteria

For **assessment criteria** to be effective, you need to tell students what you expect them to do and what a good assessment will look like.

In the project, EG-353, we do this by including a copy of the grading rubrics as illustrated here.

You might also consider providing samples of good work.


##### Assessment calendar

In the College of Engineering, the most convenient way to provide an assessment and feedback calendar is to ensure that you have completed your assessment calendar on the College Intranet. 

You can then provide a web link to the calendar on the **Assessment and Feedback** page using the URL: https://collegeintranet.swan.ac.uk/module_assessment/view_module_assessment_calendars.svlt?ayrCode=**YY**%2F18&modCode=**EGxxxxx**. 

This has the dual benefit of ensuring that your assessment calendar is correct and defined only in one place.

*slide*

You might prefer to provide a summary of assessments and deadlines in tabular form as we have done here for the 3rd year project.

##### Past papers

As part of the **Assessment and Feedback** section, It is also good practice to provide copies of past papers, exam feedback and (optionally) worked solutions. 

You should always do this for modules that are assessed only by examination.

##### My grades

You may also find it useful to insert a link to **My Grades** (from the add content **Tools** menu) so students can readily access their feedback.

#### Reading List

*slide*

The reading list link is provided automatically. It is maintained by the **Ifind Reading list** tool administered by the library. When set up for a module, it will look like this….

*slide*

If instead it looks like this … you will need to create your reading list using the **iFind Reading list** tool provided.

*slide*

Creation and maintenance of reading lists is beyond the scope of this presentation. But you can find more about **iFind Reading** -- the reading lists creation tool -- here: http://libguides.swansea.ac.uk/iFindReading.

#### Library Guide

The **Library Guides** are intended to provide signposting to the resources and services provided by our library colleagues.


*slide*

The **Library Guides** link, as delivered by the minimum standards template, opens the **Library Guides** page [libguides.swansea.ac.uk](https://libguides.swansea.ac.uk) in a new tab. Students can navigate from here to their subject specific guide.

*slide*

For this reason, I would recommend that you edit the weblink so that it opens the **Library Guide to Engineering** [libguides.swansea.ac.uk/engineering](https://libguides.swansea.ac.uk/engineering) ...

*slide*

Or the **Library Guide to Sports Science** [libguides.swansea.ac.uk/sportsscience](https://libguides.swansea.ac.uk/sportsscience) ...

as appropriate.

*slide*

... and rename the weblink from **Library Guides** to **Library Guide**.

*slide*

*Hint*: As the library guides are also for staff, for your future reference, I'd recomment that you add a hidden link to the **Full Library Guides** collection: [libguides.swansea.ac.uk](https://libguides.swansea.ac.uk). Move the hidden link below the **Staff Support** link as shown in this slide.

#### Tools

The **Tools** link is a link that exposes all the tools and plugins available to you to use as a course-site builder. 

*slide*

It’s well worth you browsing to see what extra features you can add to make your course site more engaging. You can also seek help from the SALT team if you see something you think might be useful but want advice on how to use it.

However, the Tools page not a very useful page for students (indeed they are likely to be confused by it) so I would advise you to hide the link. Instead, you should add links to any useful tools to the **Module Content** or **Assessment and Feedback** areas as appropriate.

#### Staff Support

This is a hidden link. Not visible to students. It contains the following content…

##### About this Section

This section is provided to give some general help and guidelines for staff new to Blackboard as well experienced Blackboard users who are adapting to the new minimum requirements for a Blackboard course site. 

Please note that this is indented for instructors not students and you will notice that the menu item for this section is hidden. Thus this section will not be seen by students as you can verify by switching edit mode to off or by using the student preview button (see slide).

Once you are familiar to Blackboard you may chose to delete this section entirely or keep it around for future reference and for the benefit of future staff.

##### About this Module

The **Module Information** page contains general information about this module including a module synopsis, learning outcomes, syllabus, assessment components and calendar as well as any other information that the module coordinator and/or lecturers deem to be important. The main module content (lecture headings and summaries, description of activities, seminar plans etc.) are to be found on the **Module Content** page. 

More detail on how this module will be assessed, the assessment criteria, assessment and feedback calendar etc and the actual assessment descriptions and submission tools (e.g. TurnitIn, Blackboard assessment, Quizzes) will be found on the **Assessment and Feedback** page. 

The **Staff Contacts** page gives information on how to contact the lecturers and/or coordinator of this module. The Tools page gives access to the tools that Blackboard provides for instructors and students. Not all tools will be used by all lecturers.

In addition to the standard pages listed here, individual instructors may well have more menu items and features enabled as appropriate to support the learning outcomes of this particular module. Many instructors will include a brief tour of the module site at the start of the module and will be happy to explain where things are if you get lost. Use the contact details given on the Staff Contacts page to ask questions and provide feedback on this site.

**Hint** -- the wording of this section applies equally well to students, so you could adapt the text of this section and put a copy onto the **Module Information** page as a **Module introduction**.

##### Teaching Content Required

Each module should contain **indication** of what each lecture will contain; as lecture titles themselves are rarely that informative. This **may** take the form of adding <u>at least one</u> of the following:

* Access to any presentation or discussion materials e.g. handouts, notes, PowerPoint, Prezi, pdf, Keynote, Beamer, Slideshare etc
* A summary of the main arguments
* A structure/outline of the session to be accompanied with a ‘further reading’ section
* You may wish to add additional folders to help organise content for your students

These would refresh the minds of students who did attend and provide some guidelines for absent students on where they can go to access further information.

Since 2014/15 University policy has specified that session materials be uploaded at the start of the course, or at least 24 hours before the start of each classroom session. The aim is to help students prepare better for the session and allow them to view the contents and add notes using mobile devices.  

For help with how to comply with the minimum requirements please contact the SALT team [salt@swansea.ac.uk](mailto:salt@swansea.ac.uk). Alternatively, please log a call on the ISS Servicedesk: [servicedesk.swansea.ac.uk/ServiceDesk.WebAccess/ss/](https://servicedesk.swansea.ac.uk/ServiceDesk.WebAccess/ss/).

##### [SALT Website](https://salt.swan.ac.uk)

Swansea Academy of Learning and Teaching will enhance the student learning experience through sharing and promoting good practice in learning and teaching, sponsoring and promoting pedagogic research, and enhancing the profile of learning and teaching across the institution.

As well as providing a home for resources and supporting learning and teaching enhancement, SALT will seek to develop pedagogy through seminars and workshops aimed at sharing interesting and innovative practice. In addition, the annual Excellence in Learning and Teaching Conference will showcase good and best practice from across the University.

SALT will work to develop a community of practice amongst staff at Swansea University interested in promoting excellence in learning and teaching, and enhancing the learning experience and achievement of our students.
You may access the SALT resources by following the web link: [salt.swan.ac.uk](https://salt.swan.ac.uk). The SALT website will open in a new browser window.

##### [SALT Case Studies](https://salt.swan.ac.uk/case-studies/)

A growing collection of learning and  teaching innovations by staff here at Swansea University on a wide variety of learning and teaching innovations in areas such as using clickers, discussion boards, group work.....

To contribute a case study, please contact the SALT team [salt@swansea.ac.uk](mailto:salt@swansea.ac.uk)

### Automatically Populated Content Areas

The standard Bb template has placeholders on the **Module Information** page for the **Module Synopsis**, **Learning Outcomes** and **Syllabus**. 

The template has objects that load this data automatically from the **Module Catalogue**.

To change this data, you need to visit the **Module Maintenance** page (see slides on **Module Information** above) for your module. 

Remember to choose the *current* academic year, and edit the fields shown at the left of this slide.

#### Catalogue items not copied to Bb

The module descriptor has several other sections which provide useful information for students and arguably should be included on the **Module Information** page. Unfortunately they are not!

These include:

* Notes to be printed in catalogue
* Module aims
* Transferable skills
* Delivery Method
* Adjustments for students with disabilities
* Use of E-learning for delivery and assessment

You may choose to add one or more of these sections to the **Module Information** page but there is then a danger that they are updated on Blackboard but not in the **Module Catalogue** or *vice versa*.

#### Recommendation for Module Information 

To avoid data errors, it is better to provide a link from **Module Information** your to the “source of truth” (the module catalogue record).

You can find the module descriptor (as published in the **Module Catalogue** and **College Handbooks**)  by following the links from the Intranet: **Academic Records -> Modules -> Module Catalogue** and then searching for your module from there. 

The link will always have the form: 

[https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=**EG-247**&ayr=**17/18**](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EG-247&ayr=17/18)

so you can copy the example link from this document, edit it for your module, and paste it into the address of a web link as shown in the slide. 

Be sure to use the correct module code and the current academic year (`ayr`) code.

#### Reading List

The Reading List menu item and page will be added automatically to your Bb site. It provides an active block which loads the **iFind Reading List** for students which uses the automatic feed from **Leganto Reading Lists**. You can create and maintain the reading list for your module directly from here. You should use this tool to create and maintain your reading list as it automatically adds reading list to the Course Catalogue and informs the library of your module’s needs.

You may find it more convenient to open the reading list block in a new tab.

Do not remove or edit the Reading List block in the Blackboard item editor. 

If you wish to give additional guidance for students please create a new item on the Reading List page and place it above or below the reading list block.

For support and help with reading lists please contact your Library Subject Team.

#### Library Guides

This automatically generated weblink points to the resources provided by ISS and designed to give students (and staff) quick access to library information.

For students this includes:

* Who are the librarians?
* Software and network support
* Where to find the library and books
* Borrowing and inter-library loans
* Finding books and information
* Referencing and citing
* Getting help and access to training

It’s a good idea to introduce this link to your students at the start of your module.

See the previous section on the <a href="#Library Guide">Library Guide</a> for information on how to set up this resource..

### Module Content and Inclusivity

In a new Bb site **Module Content** is an empty page with a set of hidden requirements (see <a href="#Module Content">Previous Slide</a>).

You need to add structure and provide inclusive content yourself!

For advice visit the CPD site [Blackboard Basics](https://blackboard.swan.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_53021_1&content_id=_2741527_1) provided by SALT

**Don’t underestimate the time needed to build a good site!**


### Assessment and Feedback

The minimum standards for **Assessment and Feedback** section is covered in the <a href="Assessment and Feedback">Assessment and Feedback</a> section of this presentation.

For advice on using the standard assessment tools provided in Bb and for classroom use:

* TurnitIn and Feedback studio
* Blackboard assignment tools
* Rubrics
* Blackboard quizzes
* Audience response systems
* Self and Peer Assessment

See the resources on the [SALT website](https://salt.swan.ac.uk) or seek advice from LTEC.


### Going Further

Once you have set up your Bb site to be minimum standards compliant, you will want to develop it further. For example to exploit blended learning to add opportunities to engage students in discussion, investigation, practice, collaboration and production to increase engagement and promote deeper learning.

This is beyond the scope of this presentation, but there are many resources and CPD opportunities provided by SALT ([website](https://salt.swan.ac.uk))

Also, feel free to talk to Tom Love (SALT Lead) or Chris Jobling (LTEC TEL Lead)
